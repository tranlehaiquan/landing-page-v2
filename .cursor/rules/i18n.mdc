## Locales

- Translations are centralized in
  [components/locales/index.ts](mdc:components/locales/index.ts).
- Supported languages: `VI`, `EN`, `ID`. Keys are defined in the `Contents`
  enum. The `language()` function returns a
  `Map<Languages, Map<Contents, string>>`.

## Usage guidelines

- Import `language()` once at module level in server components or per provider
  and pass strings down as props where possible.
- Prefer using enum keys from `Contents` to avoid typos. Do not hardcode
  repeated strings that exist in the locale.
- For dynamic placeholders like `{x}` or `{y}`, interpolate at usage sites. Keep
  placeholders in the copy, not numbers.

## Adding new strings

- Add a new key to `Contents` and provide translations for all supported
  languages.
- Keep sentences concise; avoid mixing formatting concerns with content. Use
  Tailwind for presentation.
