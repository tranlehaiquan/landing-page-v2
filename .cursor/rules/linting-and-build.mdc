## Root build

- `pnpm build`/`npm run build` will:
    1. install and build `webapp/`
    2. run `next build`

## Flowbite patching

- `flowbite-react patch` runs during postinstall and in the subapp build. It
  generates `.flowbite-react/class-list.json` used for Tailwind class
  safelisting.
- If classes seem missing in production, re-run the patch or `npm run build`.

## ESLint

- Next’s build may attempt to run ESLint. If ESLint is not installed, builds can
  warn/fail. Either install ESLint or disable lint during builds if necessary.

## Vite output warning

- Vite warns that `outDir` is outside project root and won’t be emptied. If you
  need a clean slate, run `vite build --emptyOutDir` within `webapp/`. Be
  cautious not to delete unrelated files in `public/play`.
