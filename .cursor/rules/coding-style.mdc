## TypeScript & React style

- Prefer explicit function signatures for exported functions and components.
- Use descriptive names; avoid 1–2 character identifiers.
- Use early returns and guard clauses to avoid deep nesting.
- Keep components small and focused. Extract UI fragments into smaller
  components when they grow.

## Client vs Server components

- Default to Server Components. Add `"use client"` only for interactive
  components.
- When using client components, colocate browser-only logic (event handlers,
  effects) there.

## Formatting

- Use Prettier (configured via scripts). Avoid reformatting unrelated code in
  edits.
- Keep lines reasonably short and readable. Favor multiline over complex
  one-liners.

## Comments

- Add comments only for non-obvious logic and to explain "why". Avoid inline
  explanatory comments inside JSX.
